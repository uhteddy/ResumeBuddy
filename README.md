# Resume Buddy
I get it, you're a Computer Science major desperately looking to apply for jobs. Yet you not only have a resume you can submit to job sites but in today's job market. you also want to make a good impression. This would mean every resume you have would need to be unique to the job you are applying to. This is especially hard when each job listing has hyper-specific criteria that you _may_ meet but would need to revamp your entire resume, go through backlogged projects, and find the best wording. 

This is the same problem I was also falling into. I was endlessly searching "AI resume builder" only to be disappointed with paywall features, locked templates, rate-limites, and so much more. And then I realized... I'm literally a computer science major applying for a software engineering position and I'm literally searching for an application to do what I am capable of building myself.

### What is Resume Buddy
That's where `Resume Buddy` comes into play, Resume Buddy is a resume builder built on-top of the LaTeX [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) template and will utilize a locally-running [ollama](https://ollama.com) instance to generate your resumes.

The idea of a resume being a "living, breathing document" is very true. Your resume should grow with you but, sometimes important information gets lost in translation. For example, as a student in computer science you _should_ have a lot of small projects that can show off a number of specific attributes from language, architecture, data structures, and frameworks used (and so, so, so much more). There are so many projects you may forget they exist and when it comes time to apply to a position you could leave out a project that matches a jobs criteria. Resume Buddy acts in the middle and allows you to input **ALL** of your projects. Resume Buddy will analyze the best project(s) depending on the job description to maximize you resume.

### Why Resume Buddy?
Resume Buddy is free and open-source. The entire purpose of this program is to democratize your ability to apply to jobs in a market that is extreemly competetive. No one should be left behind from an opportunity to having a job simply because of a Resume.
