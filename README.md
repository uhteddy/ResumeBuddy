# Resume Buddy
> This has become a mess for me personally where I've begun to discover new technologies that will be better-fit for this application. Therefore this branch is only here for a reference but will be discarded for any actual release version.

A free, open-source resume builder for Computer Science students and professionals.

## What is Resume Buddy?
Resume Buddy helps you create tailored resumes for each job application using the LaTeX Jake's Resume template and a locally-running ollama instance. It stores all your projects and intelligently selects the most relevant ones based on job descriptions, ensuring you present the perfect match for each position.

## Why Resume Buddy?
In a competitive job market, everyone deserves access to tools that help them stand out. Resume Buddy is completely free and eliminates paywalls, locked templates, and rate limits found in other resume builders.
