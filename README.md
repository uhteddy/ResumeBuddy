# Resume Buddy

I get it. You’re a Computer Science major desperately looking to apply for jobs. Yet you not only need a resume you can submit to job sites, but in today’s job market, you also want to make a good impression. That means every resume you submit should be unique to the job you're applying to. This is especially hard when each job listing has hyper-specific criteria that you may meet—but would need to revamp your entire resume, dig through backlogged projects, and find the best wording.

This was the same problem I kept running into. I was endlessly searching “AI resume builder,” only to be disappointed by paywalls, locked templates, rate limits, and so much more. And then I realized... I’m literally a Computer Science major applying for software engineering positions, and I’m out here searching for an app to do what I’m completely capable of building myself.

## What is Resume Buddy
That’s where Resume Buddy comes into play. Resume Buddy is a resume builder built on top of the LaTeX Jake’s Resume template, and it utilizes a locally-running ollama instance to generate your resumes.

The idea of a resume being a "living, breathing document" is so true. Your resume should grow with you—but sometimes, important information gets lost in translation. For example, as a Computer Science student, you should have a lot of small projects that show off a number of specific attributes: languages, architecture, data structures, frameworks used (and so, so, so much more). There are so many projects that you might forget some even exist—and when it comes time to apply for a position, you could end up leaving out a project that perfectly matches the job's criteria. Resume Buddy bridges that gap. It lets you input ALL of your projects, and then analyzes which ones best match the job description to help you build the most relevant resume possible.

## Why Resume Buddy?
Resume Buddy is free and open-source. The whole point of this program is to democratize your ability to apply to jobs in an extremely competitive market. No one should be left behind from an opportunity simply because of a resume.
